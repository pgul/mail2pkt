MAIL-TO-PKT v0.1
----------------

This program reads the standard input for a base64 mime enconded email and
decodes the attachment into the protected inbound directory, defined in
fidoconfig.

It is designed to be a procmail filter, but can be used in other ways, such
as called from within a script. If you define the right recipes for procmail,
you don't need a dedicated mail account.

To get it running, first install it. See INSTALL for details.


Config
------

If you have procmail installed and running, then you should add these lines
to your ~/.procmailrc file:

--Cut--------------
:0:
* ^Subject.*Fido
| mail2pkt
--Cut--------------

Of course you should put whatever conditions you need. Take a look at
procmailrc(5) manpage for further details.

It is suposed that mail2pkt is installed in the binary directory of husky,
and it is in the user's PATH. If not, you must put the full path to the
mail2pkt binary (i.e. /usr/bin/mail2pkt).

This way, you can make several procmail recipes for each link you have,
and don't even need a dedicated POP account!


Notes
-----

 * Only base64 encoded files will be decoded in this version! Make sure the
piped mails are base64, otherwise they will desappear. Future versions
may support different encodings.

 * Message bodys are ignored, so tell your links not to write important info
in the mails they send to you.

 * All the files are created in the protected inbound.

 * Take care of file permissions! If you receive the mail from a POP server
with a user, and process the packets with another user, there will be 
permissions troubles. A solution could be this:

The POP receiving user is pop and the fidonet processing user is fido, so:

In the /home/pop/.procmailrc, put this recipe:

--Cut--------------
:0:
* ^Subject.*Fido
! fido
--Cut--------------

In the /home/fido/.procmailrc, put this one:

--Cut--------------
:0:
* ^From.pop
| mail2pkt
--Cut--------------

Now, the files are created with the correct owner.


Feedback
--------

I wanna know who's using my program, so please write me. I hope to hear back
from you.
