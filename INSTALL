0a. make sure you have both smapi and fidoconfig libraries installed and
    working. A working version of procmail is highly recommended.
    
0b. also, you will need huskymak.cfg that comes with husky-common.tar.gz
    to compile.

1.  put the mail2pkt package in the directory where the other packages of fido
    linux reside, for example:

       /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                                 -> fidoconfig/
                                 -> mail2pkt/

2. make, install and/or clean:
	$ make
	# make install
	$ make clean
	
   make sure you use makefile.husky as the makefile (default)
   
3. Read README to find out how to get it working.
