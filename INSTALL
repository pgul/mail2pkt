0a. make sure you have both smapi and fidoconfig libraries installed and
    working. You will need a running version of procmail too.
    
0b. also, you will need huskymak.cfg that comes with husky-common.tar.gz
    to compile

1.  put the pkt2mail package in the directory where the other packages of fido
    linux reside:

       /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                                 -> fidoconfig/
                                 -> mail2pkt/

2. make, install and/or clean:
	$ make
	# make install
	$ make clean

3. Add a new entry in your .procmailrc file to call mail2pkt when a new
   email comes, for example:

-Cut-----------------------------

:0:
* Subject.*Fido
| mail2pkt

-Cut-----------------------------
