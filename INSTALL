0a. make sure you have both smapi and fidoconfig libraries installed and
    working. You will need a running version of procmail too if you do not
    have a full dedicated email account on your local system.

    to compile

    linux reside:

       /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                                 -> fidoconfig/
                                 -> mail2pkt/

2. make, install and/or clean:
	$ make
	# make install
	$ make clean
