# Sample .procmailrc file for calling mail2pkt to automatically receive
# FTN packets via email.
# Copy and rename it to ~/.procmailrc

# It is a good idea to have a log when something goes wrong

LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log

# If you have your main fidoconfig file in a non-standard file, (i.e /etc/fido)
# you must declare it here, _even_ if you already have set the FIDOCONFIG
# environment value before. I don't know why, simply procmail ignores it...

#FIDOCONFIG=$HOME/cfg/main

# Here's the main thing. If you don't want to mail2pkt to put the files in
# your protected inbound directory, just tell where you want it to put the
# files in the command line.
# Of course, you should change this regexp for one that suits you. See
# procmail man page for details.
